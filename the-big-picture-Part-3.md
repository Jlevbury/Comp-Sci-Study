## The Big Picture - Computer Science in application
 As a full-stack developer, you will often find yourself working with all of these topics together. Here's an example of how you might apply these concepts when creating a web application that uses an API to fetch data and then displays that data to the user.

Let's say we're building a movie review site where users can search for movies and see details about them. We'll use the concepts we discussed.

1. **Data Structures:** You will be dealing with lots of data from the API, probably in the form of arrays and objects (which are JavaScript's built-in implementations of stacks and queues, respectively). 

```javascript
// An example movie object we might receive from the API
var movie = {
  title: 'Inception',
  director: 'Christopher Nolan',
  year: 2010,
  reviews: ['Great movie!', 'Really makes you think', 'My favorite movie of all time']
};
```

2. **Callbacks and Higher-Order Functions:** When you fetch data from the API, you will be using asynchronous functions that utilize callbacks.

```javascript
// Using the built-in `fetch` function to make an API request.
// `fetch` is a higher-order function that takes a callback function as an argument.
fetch('https://movie-api.com/inception')
  .then(response => response.json()) // another higher-order function with a callback
  .then(movie => displayMovieDetails(movie)) // our callback function to handle the movie data
  .catch(error => console.log(error)); // our callback function to handle any errors
```

3. **Closures and Factory Functions:** Let's say you have a feature where users can save their favorite movies. You could use a factory function to create a `user` object that has access to a `favorites` array through a closure.

```javascript
function createUser(name) {
  var favorites = [];
  
  return {
    name: name,
    addFavorite: function(movie) {
      favorites.push(movie);
    },
    getFavorites: function() {
      return favorites;
    }
  };
}

var user = createUser('Alice');
user.addFavorite(movie);
console.log(user.getFavorites()); // logs: [ { title: 'Inception', director: 'Christopher Nolan', year: 2010, reviews: [Array] } ]
```

4. **Recursion and Big O Notation:** Perhaps users can comment on reviews, and comments can have replies, and replies can have their own replies, and so on. You could use a recursive function to display these comments with their replies. When considering the efficiency of your recursive function, you would need to consider the Big O Notation.

```javascript
// An example of how comments might be stored
var comments = [
  {
    text: 'Great movie!',
    replies: [
      {
        text: 'I agree!',
        replies: []
      },
      {
        text: 'Not my favorite, but it was good',
        replies: [
          {
            text: 'I respect your opinion',
            replies: []
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    text: 'Really makes you think',
    replies: []
  }
];

// A recursive function to display comments and their replies
function displayComments(comments, indentation = '') {
  for (var i = 0; i < comments.length; i++) {
    console.log(indentation + comments[i].text);
    displayComments(comments[i].replies, indentation + '  ');
  }
}

displayComments(comments);
```

This outputs:

```
Great movie!
  I agree!
  Not my favorite, but it was good
    I respect your opinion
Really makes you think
```

5. **Execution Contexts:** Throughout all of this code, JavaScript is creating and managing execution contexts. Understanding these helps you understand how JavaScript is managing variables and `this`.

* The Global Execution Context is created when the script starts running. Global variables like `movie`, `user`, and `comments` are declared in this context.

* Each function call creates a new Functional Execution Context. For example, when `fetch` is called, a new context is created for that call. The variables and functions defined within that call (like `response`) are part of that function's execution context.

* Higher order functions like `fetch` and `then` also handle their callbacks' execution contexts. They essentially say, "I'm going to do some stuff that will take some time. Here's a new execution context for you to work in while I'm doing that."

* Finally, the `this` keyword's value is determined based on its execution context. In the global execution context, `this` is the global object (`window` in browsers). In the `displayComments` function, `this` would be the global object (or `undefined` in strict mode), and in the `addFavorite` and `getFavorites` methods, `this` would be the `user` object.

These concepts all intertwine and are fundamental to understanding JavaScript and programming more generally. Understanding them will not only help you write code but also debug issues, discuss code with other developers, and learn new parts of JavaScript or even other programming languages.
